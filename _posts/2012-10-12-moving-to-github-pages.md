I have decided to ditch the hopeless project of trying to get my personal website running on Drupal. It is just to complex for something so simple. Even though I work with Drupal websites every day my plan of using it for my personal site is just draining the project and making sure it will never finish.

I will make a new blog using github pages and jekyll, seems like a much smoother setup for the purpose.

The process have begun and you are looking at it right now :)
